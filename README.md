# Typescript Base For Technical Test

Make sure to:
- Clone this repository locally.
- Set up your preferred coding environment or IDE.
- Install the dependencies.
- Successfully run the default test.

During the test:
- I'll provide you with an exercise.
- I want you to implement the function that fits the specs.
- No stress about finishing on time; I'm more interested in looking at how you think and work.
- Be prepared to share your entire screen so that I can follow along, especially if you use different tools.
